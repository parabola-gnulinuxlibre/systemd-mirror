This repository is a consolidated mirror of systemd and its various
downstreams.  This aims to solve the problem that it's very easy to
loose track of which fork a given tag came from.

Sources that we mirror:

 - `systemd` itself (of course), and `udev`: https://github.com/systemd/systemd.git
 - `sytemd-stable`: https://github.com/systemd/systemd-stable.git
 - `elogind`: https://github.com/elogind/elogind.git
 - `eudev`: https://github.com/gentoo/eudev.git
 - `notsystemd`: https://github.com/parabola-gnulinuxlibre/notsystemd.git
 - `parabola`: the patches that [Arch](https://archlinux.org) and
   [Parabola](https://parabola.nu) ship with their packages: https://github.com/parabola-gnulinuxlibre/systemd-parabola.git

This `main` branch that this README.md and the scripts for updating
the other refs; other than that all refs are generated by the
`./fetch.sh` script, and are all named such that it should be clear
which repository they are synced from.  Care is taken to avoid
confusing duplicate tags.
